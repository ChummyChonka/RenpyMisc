# RenpyMisc
A range of various Renpy files implementing different stuff

## Parallax Effect using the 3D Stage
Pretty much says it all. I've including a function to get decent zoom levels that will work on a 21:9 display still. The game still tracks your mouse outside of the main game screen, on the black edges you would get on an ultrawide display. 

## Grid with multiple pages
One way to implement a grid that has multiple pages and buttons to switch between those.
